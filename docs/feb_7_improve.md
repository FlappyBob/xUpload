# 1 Bug + 1 Improve
# Bug: error of uploading file

# Improve: seamless file scanning
- User config: let user config some folders to scan
- Track uploading history

# Recommandation
- Search with file path (e.g. resume folder is more likely under job website)
- Search with file name (e.g. screen shot with name "2026 Feb 7...png" is more likely to get uploaded to gpt)
- Search with file content (e.g. screen shot with command line error outputs is more likely to get uploaded to gpt for asking error related questions)
