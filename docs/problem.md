## problem

1. I encouter Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405 () when retrieving file, but it is ok once I reloading those files from the folder.

what I want: once I click and found there is en error(either not found or other error) => rescan all the files again and try retrieve that file, show the preview of the file, and give another button for users -- accept that file and load that file into the required blank

2. show me the logic how we retrieve each file in the folder specified by the user and how to embedded each file into embedding vectors
